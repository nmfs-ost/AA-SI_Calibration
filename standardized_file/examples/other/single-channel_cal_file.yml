# Should there be some cruise metadata so the file can be linked to a survey?
# ?YES. We should work the NCEI to ensure we can link to a survey or set of data 

# ?should we have fields explicitly for units?
# ?I think it would be best to have a units field for each value, in addition the comment

###
# one organizational question is do we have one of these files per channel or multiple channels within this file? In general, all channels are calibrated at the same time for a given survey or set of data. But, that is not always the case, and those cases are not rare, or maybe not even uncommon. 
# Organization methods:
# 1. The most general method seems to me to have one yaml file per channel. This will result in a fair amount of duplication of metadata, but I think it is the cleanest. 
# 2. One file for the channels that were calibrated at that time. This has less duplication, but I think more ambiguity if a set of channels were calibrated on one date and another set on another date.
# 3. One file for all the channels. This will require a code for each channel as to whether the calibration is valid or not for that calibration exercise.

# ?I added all the fields from AcMeta
# ?I added Brett's fields as well
