# Calibration File Road Map
The goal is to apply the correct calibration values to data files.

- Stage 1
  - The user selects a set of data files to do "something" with.
  - "Something" includes:
    - Upload the files to NCEI, e.g., using Tugboat
    - Upload the files to the AA-SI storage bucket
    - Download the files to local storage

- Stage 2
  - The selected data files are read and a list of unique channels is generated.
